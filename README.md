## Description
After wire framing, we utilized Microsoft Team Services to do sprint planning, daily scrums and sprint check-in, burn-down reports to deliver and present our project. We used AngularJS to receive user input filter and store it in a local RESTful API with C# and merge filtered results with The Google Maps API to display personalized results. After testing, and debugging, the CSS Bootstrap and downloadable personal images lend the personal UI touch.
